7_1 Final Project Submission Project


Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.


This submission was a final project for Computer Science 210.

It is a list of sold items. 

The assignment had three parts.

1)  to display the list of Items as Item-Quantity.
2) be able to input an item name  and get back the quantity,
3) List items and show quantity as (*) in a histogram.

A menu was created using C++.
And read and write of file was done using Python.
With Python function calls in the C++ program. 


What did you do particularly well?
I called the functions correctly form the Python Code into the C++ program correctly and the programmed worked as designed.


Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
C++ as a program is not as secure as other languages, I could to write in another language. If i researched more my code become 
more efficient. Other improvements would be to the UI/UX , C++ is really a good language at this and I would love to have more
time to make this program sparkle.


Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The reading and writing from the text file into Python code was the most challenging. I researched and found an include file called collections that handled counting the occurences of Items
in short order.



What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
This was my first time using two languages in tandem in this manner. I llok forward to doing it again.


How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I beleive my code was well commented. spaced correctly for readability. also it could be used for a program of a similiar type.
